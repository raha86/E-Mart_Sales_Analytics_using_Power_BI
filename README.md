# Problem Statement:
The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales performance for E-Mart, a leading company in the retail sector. By delving into various aspects of sales, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), and developing robust forecasting models, the objective is to equip Emart with actionable insights to optimize its sales strategies, drive revenue growth, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

# Solution Approach:
To address the problem statement, the following approach was used:

# * Data Import and Initial Analysis:
The sales data was provided in a CSV file was imported. Initial insights were drawn from the data to gain a preliminary understanding of the sales trend.

# * Data Modeling and Relationship Creation:
Data modeling was performed within Power BI to create relationships between the relevant tables. This step ensured that the data could be properly analyzed and visualized.

# * Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Power BI's data transformation features, such as Power Query, were utilized to clean and transform the data. Irrelevant entries, duplicates, and inconsistencies were removed or resolved, ensuring the data was accurate and reliable. Also some new colums were introduced for simplification of data.

# * Dashboard Creation:
The created dashboard shows fields like 'Total Sales Value', 'Total Quantities Sold', 'Total Profit', 'Average Delivery Time'. It also shows 'YoY Sales by Month', 'YoY Profit by Month', 'Sales by State', 'Mode of payment', 'Sales by category', 'Sales by Segments', 'Sales by Region', 'Sales by Sub-Categories' and 'Shipping Mode'. We can also view the data by selecting different Regions from the slicer for specific regions. A Dashboard for data forecasting is also created which shows 15 days forecast of sales amount, sales quantity and profit.

The dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific dimensions or time periods of interest.
